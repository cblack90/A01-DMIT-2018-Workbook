ListView Dive
-good for full CRUD processes
-have navigation properties - Address.City - doesn't work
-public virtual is lazy loading - wont try and bring in all the related data for the related entity
	-only bring back the property that is mapped
-what if we do want include Address info - ....Suppliers.Include("Address").ToList(); 
	-works, but not the best solution
	-better solution - ... Suppliers.Include(nameof(Supplier.Address)).ToList();
