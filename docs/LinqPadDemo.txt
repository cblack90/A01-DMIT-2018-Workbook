Reshape Data:
Making the data in a shape that is more meaningful to the user. Create a good experience for the customer. Think of data from the perspective of how the user needs to work
with it. Effectively de-normalize the database.
Reshaping happens in the BLL.  Last semester, the BLL was thin because we were doing CRUD.  This semester we will flesh that out more.

To achieve usable interfaced we will need to know:

-Transform Data
	-Reading/Querying the Data
		-LINQ
		-+classes (combined with LINQ) whose "Shape" matches our UI needs.(Display)
	-Issueing Commands
		-Business oriented commands
			-Process as Transaction
-Present our Data in UI
-Process our Data in UI (send it to the BLL) -Done in Code Behind
-Security

kay to reading code is the understand the undelining lanugage. - what they are and what they represent.

IEnumerable - known is an interface
Kind of like a List<t> - collection
Enumerate - collection, count off -go through a bunch of different things

**look up "yield" keyword on own, works with Enums
**Edit Preferences -> show line numbers

Adding comments under your code will help with deeper understanding of the language.
.Dump() is known as an Extension method - usually with collections

Can do a .Count() on an IEnumerable
